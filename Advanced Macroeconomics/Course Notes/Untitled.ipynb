    "## Ex Ante vs. Ex Post\n",
    "\n",
    "When speaking about expectations, it is not obvious how one measures expectations. If we take the New Classical economics at face value, observed prices include all available information. In equilibrium, inflation expectations match inflation. Thus, there is no distinction between ex ante and ex post except for new information that is exogenously imposed upon the system. Whether or not expectations are correct on average, discrepancies are meaningful. n particular, discrepancies that occur during periods of great tumult. Although committed New Classical economists would not appreciate the word, these periods of **disequilibrium** play a significant role in the future evolution of economic activity and, therefore, inform policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So where do we find inflation expectations in financial markets? A common approach is to use the TIPS spread in order to calculate the breakeven inflation rate. TIPS are inflation adjusted U.S. Treasuries. Investors in TIPS are compensated for CPI inflation. The TIPS spread is formed by taking the difference of rates on standard U.S. Treasuries and inflation protected U.S. Treasuries. This difference indicates inflation expectations over the maturity of the security. Securities of different maturities will reflect different sets of inflation expectations since the information reflected in these measures of expectations cover different time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, TIPS have only been offered relatively recently. There are [alternative measures](https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/inflation-expectations/faqs.aspx) provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. The [estimates](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXPINF1YR) are constructed using \"Treasury yields, inflation data, inflation swaps, and survey-based measures of inflation expectations\". We can compare these rates of inflation to year-over-year inflation to consider the extent to which these values tend to match. \n",

    "\n",
    "Friedman presents yet another formulation for macroeconomic theory that bears much resemblance to the real cash balance approach that we used previously. Here, however, we will leverage the value of nominal income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friedman removes real income from the function of liquidity preference:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_D=Y \\mathcal{L}(r)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Money demand is a function of nominal income and the interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the IS-LM model, consumption and investment are also given as a function of the interest rate. While Friedman does not appreciate this approach, he does restate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C = Yf(r)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I = Yg(r)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, Friedman follows fisher such that the nominal rate is a function of the real rate of interest, $\\rho$ and inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\rho + \\pi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this must be stated in terms of expectations so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\rho_e + \\pi_e$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Friedman cleverly restates r by redefining p as the diference between nominal and real income. This allows the real rate to be stated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\rho_e + \\%\\Delta Y - \\$\\Delta y$$\n",
    "$$r = \\rho_e - g_e + \\%\\Delta Y _e$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Friedman asserts that the discrepancy between the expected real rate of interest and the expected rate of real income growth is determined outside of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_e - g_e = k_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Friedmn argues that the savings rate and the real interest rate are interact to form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_e - g_e = (1 - s^*)\\rho_e = c^*\\rho_e$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this implies that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s^* = \\frac{g_e}{\\rho_e}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing $s^*$, we can thus calculate $g_e$, the expected real growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by assuming that $s = s^*$. We will calculate s by adding together real private investment, $I$, and real domestic investment, $G$. We will divide this sum by real income, $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After using regression, we will back calculate s:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g_e = \\rho_e + \\%\\Delta Y _e - r\n"
