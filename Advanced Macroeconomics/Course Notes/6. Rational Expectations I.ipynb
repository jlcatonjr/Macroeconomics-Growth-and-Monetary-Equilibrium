    "Two challenging observations observed by Muth:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Averages of expectations in an industry are more accurate than naive models and as accurate as elaborate equation systems, although there are considerable cross-sectional differences of opinion\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reported expectations generally understimtae the extent of changes that actually take place\n",
    "\n",
    "The rational expectaions hypothesis asserts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Information is scarce, and the economic system generally does not waste it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The way expectations are formed depends specifically on the teh structure of the relevant system describing the economy\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A 'public prediction,' in the sense of Grunberg and Modigliani, will have no substantial effect on the operation of the economic system (unless it is based on inside information. This is not quite the same thing as stating that the marginal revenue product of economics is zero, because expectations of a single firm may still be subject to greater error than theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It *oes not* assert that the scratch work of entrepreneurs resembles the system of equations in any way; nor does it state that predictions of entreprenerus are perfect or that their expectations are all the same.\"\n",

    " 2. Certainty equivalents exist for the variable to be predicted.\n",
