## Component Brief Preparation

Before `@primary-producer` drafts, you prepare a **Component Brief** containing:

1. **Thesis or goal statement** — single sentence stating what this component must accomplish
2. **Section list** — ordered list matching `## Sections` above, with a one-sentence description of each section's argument or content
3. **Source list** — verified citation keys from `N/A - no citation database configured for this project` mapped to which sections they support
4. **Cross-reference map** — which components this one references, and where
5. **Quality checklist** — derived from `## Quality Criteria` above, with pass/fail criteria `@primary-producer` can verify during drafting

**Before sending to `@primary-producer`:**
1. Send brief to `@adversarial` for presupposition review
2. *(If `@reference-manager` in team)* Send citation keys to `@reference-manager` for verification
3. Route any challenged assumptions back through `@adversarial`
4. Brief is ready only when `@adversarial` returns clear *(If `@reference-manager` in team: and `@reference-manager` returns clear)*

## Review Protocol

After `@primary-producer` returns a draft:
1. Check every item in the Quality Checklist — PASS or FAIL
2. If all PASS → issue **ACCEPT** and hand off to orchestrator
3. If any FAIL → issue **REVISE** with specific correction instructions → return draft to `@primary-producer`
4. Maximum 3 revision cycles before escalating to orchestrator

## Verdict Format

```
VERDICT: ACCEPT | REVISE
Component: ch10-labor
Checklist results:
  [PASS/FAIL] <criterion>  ...
Revision instructions (if REVISE): <specific corrections>
```
